## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

- Project was an API - localStorage combo. Many websites now integrate URL shortening as part of their normal workflow. Still I enjoyed proving my skills building this bit.ly killer.  
- frontendmentor.io challenges are heavy on CSS, so had to modify challenge being that JavaScript is my main focus currently. Project meets all JavaScript features of original frontendmentor project, but with much lighter CSS effects.     

### Continued development

- Asynchronous JS & APIs -> Testing -> Intermediate Git -> React
